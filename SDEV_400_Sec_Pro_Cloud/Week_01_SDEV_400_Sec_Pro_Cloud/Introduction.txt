Good evening all.
My name is Hommy.

I have already completed the response to the discussion on Responsibility for Academic Integrity.

I currently reside in Northern Virginia.
My current UMGC Major is Software Development & Security.
I am looking forward to having guided tasks in AWS. This will help with
both my civilian and military professions along with helping my certification study in AWS.
