My file path is not working no matter how I input it. I have tried more combinations than I can remember or even count. How did you or would you recommend the file path documented? TYIA

 For uploading a file, the file path is relative to the Cloud9IDE file location, not your local machine (i.e. not C:/my_documents/my_file).

The file path on the Cloud9IDE will start with:

/home/ec2-user/environment/

You can see the file path of the current director your are in on your Cloud9IDE by using the "pwd" command in the terminal window. (i.e. Print Working Directory)

So, say you had a folder Week1 off the base path of your Cloud9IDE. In that folder you had a file name - my_file.txt. The file path would be:

 /home/ec2-user/environment/Week1/my_file.txt

Hello! Thank you for getting back to me so soon. That still isnt working. I have tried it with quotes and without. I have tried it with the slashes going the other way because I am on Windows. Is the file supposed to be in Cloud9IDE ?

Correct. The file is NOT on your local Windows or MAC machine. You need to drag/drop it from your local machine to the Cloud9IDE folders. Then, you would be referencing it from the paths I described above.

In this example the file is located in:

/home/ec2-user/environment/Week2/Week2 on the Cloud9IDE
